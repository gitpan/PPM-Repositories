        }

DESCRIPTION
    This is a list of all known ppm repositores (barring the activestate
    ones). Currently, most of them are Win32 specific, mainly because the
    *nix folks have CPAN/CPANPLUS as well as free compilers.

    An example entry in %Repositories looks like:

        datetime => {
            location  => 'http://datetime.perl.org/download',
            Type      => 'Webpage',
            Active    => 1,
            Notes     => 'Get your DateTime modules here',
            PerlV     => [ 5.6, 5.8 ],
            PerlO     => ['MSWin32'],
        },

    The meaning of the key/value pairs should be obvious.

    Active is either 1, or 0, and it indicates whether or not that
    particular repository existed (you could reach it via the internet), and
    contained ppm packages, when this module was released.

    PerlO is the value of $^O.

        $^O values for various operating systems:
